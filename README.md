# Project Template

This is an example of how a cogtoolslab project repo should be organized.

Note that one of the first things to do is to update the `.gitignore` in your new project repo. A good rule of thumb is to ignore all data files (e.g., images, videos, byproducts of compiling LaTeX source, etc.) and anything likely to contain sensitive information (e.g., auth text files). Also ignore the annoying `.DS_Store` file that is part of MacOS. 

```
.DS_Store
*.csv
*.json
*.pdf
*.png
*.jpeg
*.jpg
*.tiff
*.svg
*.eps
*.ai
auth.json
auth.txt
```
