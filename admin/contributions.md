# Contributions Log

The purpose of this document is to give all researchers involved in a project the opportunity to describe their contributions to a project, so that the researcher team can make sound decisions about authorship when preparing a project for publication. 

Here are some guidelines:
* Each researcher should create a new section for themselves and use their name as the section header. In that section, please structure your contributions as a bullet-point list. 
* Please be concrete and aim to describe your contributions at a moderate level of abstraction -- neither too granular nor too general. 
* Each researcher should mention these contributions only *after* they have made them, rather than prior to making them (e.g., as a commitment device). 
* Each researcher should feel free to update this document throughout the project lifecycle, rather than only at the beginning or end.
* If there is a researcher on the team who is unable to directly edit this Markdown file for any reason, please ask this individual to email their contribution to another member of the team who can. 
* Every researcher should have their contributions explicitly documented here before final authorship decisions are made.
